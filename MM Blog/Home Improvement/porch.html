      <p>Smiles, paint fumes, and new beginnings. Michael's old apartment porch needed an upgrade for Spring. Michael has been
        renting his apartment in south Denver for over two years now. And like a lot of things in our lives, time has a way
        of leading to wear and neglete. I was ready to redo his extra storage unit of a porch into something amazing. A spot him
        and I would want to spend the cool spring nights sipping wine and reading our favorite books.

      <p>The apartment porch was well... sad. Lots of trash, an old bike, and old boring furniture. It was time for an upgrade! All the porch needed was time and some of our favorite things. Flowers, herbs, copperfinishes, it was time to work some magic. We decided to plants flower seeds and bulbs, redo his old worn furniture set, and creat a perfect happy place with great little finishes.

        <p>We had a lot of available pots passed down from Michael's mom from a recent move to texas. So it was time to fill the pots with love, water, seeds and bulbs. On a recent trip to Ace Hardware we found some beautiful butterfly bulbs and morning glory seeds that we were excited to give a go.

          <p> When I first sat in Michal's ummm classic patio furniture, it gave me a splinter. Pokey, worn, paintless, and old - it was time to give the furniture a face lift. Recently I have loved the color copper and wanted to paint the furniture a lovely rose copper color to make the furniture pop. I contrasted the pop of copper with a dark wood stain finish fort the table top and chair arms. For tips and tricks see our short article on redoing your patio furniture.

            <p> It was time to bring it all together and make it a place truly special to us. We found lovely copper LED lights and hung them from the roof. The lights really set the mood late into the evening. Also I found a cute letter art sign which I put our intials on to mark the space ours. Lastly we wanted to add layers and demention to our patio we put up plant hangers, a rail flower box, and a wood box.
